# code visualizer

Copy and paste your code with C-like syntax into the textbox, and it will be visualized as nested boxes.

A single click will change the boxes' colors.

A double click will collapse a box.

This may be more illustrative than your original IDE.

**USAGE**

Open the .html file in your browser.

Click on [DARK/LIGHT] to change the color theme.

When you change the textbox, the boxes are rerendered immediately.

**NOTE**

This code will not bypass escaped braces and stuff. 

Got to implement this yet.
